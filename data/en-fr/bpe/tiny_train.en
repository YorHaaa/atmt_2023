no one knows his name .
I &apos;m on to you .
it &apos;s blowing very hard .
I didn &apos;t know you were still here .
we talked about everything we could think about .
I don &apos;t have much time .

the poor cat was run over by a truck .
I don &apos;t want to get involved in that business .
there isn &apos;t any problem at all .
I was over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
the boy was clever enough to solve the puzzle .
I live with a por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine .

I &apos;m as curious as you are .
Oh , how we laughed !
what &apos;s your occup@@ ation ?
that picture does not do justice to him .
don &apos;t cut in while we &apos;re talking .
it &apos;s because I was asked to come that I &apos;m here .
I really wish I could go with you , but I can &apos;t .
he is wise who neither hopes nor fears anything from the un@@ certain future .
our class has twenty @-@ five boys and twenty girls .
go away before they see you here .
I &apos;m with them now .
